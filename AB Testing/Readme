My A/B Testing project depended heavily on hypothesis testing, bootstrapping, and logistic regression. Central Limit Theorem, sampling distribution, and p-value concepts were thoroughly utilized for result analysis. My goal was to test the effectiveness of a new page in converting users compared to the old page. The two approaches (bootstrapping and logistic regression) agreed that the new page did not bring a statistical and practical change to the proportion of users converted. The results and approaches were clear and were approved as one of my projects for the Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) offered by Udacity.
