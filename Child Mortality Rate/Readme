A comprehensive exploratory data analysis project to investigate international child mortality rate (CMR) 
utilizing Python and more specifically the Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and StatsModels packages. 
In this project, I was interested in identifying the association between CMR and improved sanitation, 
government spending, and life expectancy. I performed thorough data cleaning, data exploration, 
and a multiple linear regression to prove the negative association between CMR and the aforementioned factors. 

This project is part of the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.
